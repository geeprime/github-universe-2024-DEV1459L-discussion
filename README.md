Universe Session Track: Developer Experience [DEV1459L](https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe24/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog/session/1715291080280001Nea7)

> Enterprises are tightly regulated and necessary controls limit what employees can do, often to the detriment of developers. A developer's ability to innovate and experiment is stymied by privileged access to corporate-issued devices and developer tools that are pre-configured and deployed by central IT. Join this discussion facilitated by Jim Richer, distinguished engineer, at TD Bank, to take a look at what these controls are and how to enforce themâ€”all while still championing creativity. 

I'm excited to learn about what the developer experience is like for all software engineers, and how it may be impacted by corporate controls implemented by your respective control partners (and why it feels like someone called "the fun police" when new controls are implemented). These controls are important, as they exist to protect the customers of their respective organizations. They cannot be ignored, so lets discuss what approaches we can take to foster creativity within those constraints!

I would love to learn:

1. What industry are you working in?
1. What are the controls that impact you, and why do they matter?
1. What do these control implementations look like, and how do they get in the way?
1. How can we respect the spirit of the control, and develop solutions that encourage creativity within those controls?
1. When necessary, how can we find more creative ways to re-imagine control implementations that continue to protect the corporation and its customers, while ensuring developers have more freedom to focus on delivering more great features to those same customers?

I'm excited to hear what you all have to say! If you happen to attend GitHub Universe 2024, please swing by for some in-person feedback!
